## Generic Families & Font Families

Generic families are the big three:

1. serif
2. sans-serif
3. monospace

Font families are those which fall under one of those three big branches.

1. serif -> Times New Roman
2. sans-serif -> Helvetica
3. monospace -> Courier New

## Browser Font Settings

Users can select which generic family and/or font family will be imposed onto every page they visit.

If they just have it set to default, the following can occur:

1. users see the default font on their OS if you never use the `font-family` property in your CSS
2. users download a webfont when visiting a site (e.g. one from Google fonts if their browser hasn't chached that particular one yet)
3. users download a font from that website's server (e.g. we manually include font files within our project directory )
