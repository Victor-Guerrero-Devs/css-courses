## Flexbox Benefits

As already seen, we had to use some hacky methods to get items aligned to where we wanted them to be in their containers.

We used stuff like `inline-block`, `vertical-align`, `calc()`

We can instead use flexbox for a much easier experience and cleaner CSS.

## Understanding Flexbox

1. apply `display: flex;` to a container
2. all of the elements nested within it are now `flex-items`
3. you can now arrange the items easily
