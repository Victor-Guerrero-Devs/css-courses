# 5. Natours w/ Adv CSS & SASS

Before beginning, open a terminal with two tabs that are in the project directory `2-nautours-intro/`

and run 

`sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w`

and 

`live-server`

Let's get started!! (remember, in order to save space on github by not spamming a new project repo with 20mb of images, all changes to the project are in `2-nautours-intro/`)
