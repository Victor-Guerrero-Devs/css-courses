# 7. Trillo - Master Flexbox 

## Flexbox Philosophy

Instead of using floats and tables like we did in the last project, flexbox allows us to make flex containers which in turn can align the items inside EASILY. 

## Trillo - Project Overview 

We will build the UI for a webapp for checking out hotels. 

Obviously, it doesn't work; it's just for design practice. 

We will be using SASS once again but a lot more stripped down (our sass directory will not use the 5-1 architecture from the last project. just 4 separate scss files)
