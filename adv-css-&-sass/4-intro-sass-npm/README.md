## What is SASS?
 
- CSS preprocessor
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor

- let's you write CSS in an easier way especially for larger projects
	- CSS by itself can get very messy after a certain point 
- is converted into regular CSS by a SASS compiler 

There are many other CSS preprocessors but SASS is the most popular one. 

### SASS Features 

- variables 
- nesting selectors inside of each other 
- operators 
- partials & imports
- mixins 
- functions
- extends 
- control directives 

### SASS vs SCSS syntax 

SASS syntax doesn't use curly braces and relies exclusively on indendations 

SCSS syntax uses both curly braces and indendations so it is much easier to 
use. 

Use SCSS syntax instead.
