# 9. Nexter Project - Master CSS Grid Layouts

## Overview 

- build a landing page for a fictional fancy home realtor 
- will use grid to create the overall layout as well as the layout for component items
- in fact, since we are using this project to focus on grid, grid will be used A LOT 
- use SASS 

### First Steps 

- make a SASS folder and make two files `main.scss` and `_base.scss`
- we will not be using a fancy directory system for this project 
- all scss files will just be lumped together in `sass/`
- import `_base.scss` into `main.scss` 
- add the color variables and font variables and basic macro styles to `_base.scss` 
- eventually in `_base.scss` we will also made variables for the basic breakpoints
